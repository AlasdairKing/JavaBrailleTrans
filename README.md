# BrailleTrans for Java 1.0
December 2004. Copyright 2001, 2004 Alasdair King.

This is a free text (Unicode or ANSI) to Braille (American Braille Code) translator. 

BrailleTrans comes in the form of a Java package and a set of translation files that allow applications to be built that convert text to Braille. Grade 1 and Grade 2 contractions and international character sets (Unicode) are all supported.

This folder contains all the Java source code for BrailleTrans for Java.
* uk/ac/umist/co/brailletrans	- translation library
* uk/ac/umist/co/brailletrans/utils	- create translation files 
* uk/ac/umist/co/brailletrans/tests	- utilities to run translation and test

You can find translation language files in translate.zip (not in this folder).

You will need them to actually do any translation.
